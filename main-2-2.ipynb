This is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n\nTherefore, one can first tackle the electronic problem with the nuclear coordinates entering only as parameters. The energy levels of the electrons in the molecule can then be found by solving the non-relativistic time independent Schrödinger equation,\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{el}} |\\Psi_{n}\\rangle = E_{n} |\\Psi_{n}\\rangle\n$$\n\nwhere \n\n$$\n\\mathcal{H}_{\\text{el}} = - \\sum_i \\frac{\\nabla_{r_i}^2}{m_e} - \\sum_I\\sum_i  \\frac{Z_I e^2}{|R_I-r_i|} + \\sum_i \\sum_{j>i} \\frac{e^2}{|r_i-r_j|}.\n$$\n\nIn particular the ground state energy is given by:\n$$\nE_0 = \\frac{\\langle \\Psi_0 | H_{\\text{el}} | \\Psi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi_0 | \\Psi_0 \\rangle}\n$$\nwhere $\\Psi_0$ is the ground state of the system. \n\nHowever, the dimensionality of this problem grows exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom. To tackle this issue we would like to prepare $\\Psi_0$ on a quantum computer and measure the Hamiltonian expectation value (or $E_0$) directly. \n\nSo how do we do that concretely? \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Starting from the Hartree-Fock solution \n\nA good starting point for solving this problem is the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. This method approximates the N-body problem by N one-body problems where each electron evolves in the mean-field of the others. Classically solving the HF equations is efficient and leads to the exact exchange energy but does not include any electron correlation. Therefore, it is usually a good starting point to which to add correlation. \n\nThe Hamiltonian can then be re-expressed in the basis of the solutions of the HF method, also called Molecular Orbitals (MOs):\n\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{elec}=\\sum_{pq} h_{pq} \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_p \\hat{a}_q + \n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{pqrs} h_{pqrs}  \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_p \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_q \\hat{a}_r  \\hat{a}_s\n$$\nwith the 1-body integrals\n$$\nh_{pq} = \\int \\phi^*_p(r) \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\nabla^2 - \\sum_{I} \\frac{Z_I}{R_I- r} \\right)   \\phi_q(r)dr\n$$\nand 2-body integrals\n$$\nh_{pqrs} = \\int \\frac{\\phi^*_p(r_1)  \\phi^*_q(r_2) \\phi_r(r_2)  \\phi_s(r_1)}{|r_1-r_2|}dr_1dr_2.\n$$\n\nThe MOs ($\\phi_u$) can be occupied or virtual (unoccupied). One MO can contain 2 electrons. However, in what follows we actually work with Spin Orbitals which are associated with a spin up ($\\alpha$) of spin down ($\\beta$) electron. Thus Spin Orbitals can contain one electron or be unoccupied.\n\nNote: when referring to the number of orbitals, we will be using the number of _spatial_ orbitals. This refers to any orbital in Cartesian space (whether its a molecular orbital or in another basis does not matter here). Each spatial orbital is then generally split into two _spin_ orbitals.\n\nWe now show how to concretely realise these steps with Qiskit.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Obtaining an initial Hartree-Fock solution\n\nQiskit is interfaced with different classical codes which are able to find the HF solutions.
